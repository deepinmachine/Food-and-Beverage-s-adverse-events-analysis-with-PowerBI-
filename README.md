This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze adverse event reports within the food and beverage industry. Leveraging advanced data visualization techniques, the dashboard enhances the visualization of trends and demographics associated with adverse events, providing actionable insights for consumer safety and quality analysis. Key features of this dashboard include interactive visuals to display adverse event trends over time, by gender, age, and product involvement. The project also incorporates a severity index for adverse events using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI, enabling stakeholders to assess and manage risks effectively. By providing clear and dynamic visualizations coupled with insightful analytics, this dashboard aids industry professionals in making informed decisions to enhance consumer safety and product quality.
